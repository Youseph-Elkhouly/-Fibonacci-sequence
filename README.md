# -Fibonacci-sequence
This template implements the Fibonacci sequence using both recursive and iterative methods. For valid input n (n > 0), it calculates the nth Fibonacci number, demonstrating two approaches. The recursive method calls itself, while the iterative method uses loops. The program handles user input and validates n before computing results.
